## statement: 
Can you decrypt this message? <br> Decrypt this message using this key "CYLAB".
<br>

## solution:
So this obvioulsy just a vignere cipher, so I just went to: [My own coded website](https://cipher-website-code.vercel.app/) and put the encrypted message and key there.<br>
Which gives me: ``PICOCTF{O0LW_WP3_V1F3Q3T3_C1AG3U_CB82272Z}''<br>
Which is obviouly...... NOT the answer??<br>
Let me try using picoCTF.<br>
STILL NOT THE ANSWER??<br>
Haaaa (sigh of exasperation), I think I know what the issue is, My site does not cater to smallcase, so It's decoding incorrectly.<br>
As I bury my head in shame and head to [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher) and decrypt it, I get: ``picoCTF{D0NT_US3_V1G3N3R3_C1PH3R_ae82272q}``<br>
Which I submit and turns out to be the correct answer, the day sets as I realise that I need to include smallcase as well in my own code.<br>
